Prompt for Building Yummy Menu Site
I need to build a new, standalone "Menu Website" repository. This site will display the public menu for a restaurant by fetching data from our existing backend.

1. Backend Connection
The backend is hosted at: https://yummy-321287803064.asia-south1.run.app

Please implement the data fetching logic using standard 
fetch
 or axios. Key Endpoints to Explore:

GET /products?restaurant_id=<ID> (Most likely)
GET /menu?restaurant_id=<ID>
GET /categories?restaurant_id=<ID>
Note: You may need to inspect the API docs at /docs on the base URL if these standard paths don't work immediately.

2. Core Features
Restaurant Context: The site should probably work by passing a ?restaurant_id=1 query parameter in the URL, or be hardcoded for a specific restaurant if needed.
Menu Display:
Show categories (e.g., Starters, Mains, Drinks).
Display items grid with Images, Correct Names, and Prices.
Optionally show a "Sold Out" badge if status is unavailable.
No Auth Required: This is a public menu view, so it should not require a login token.
3. Configuration & Security
.env: Do NOT copy your full backend 
.env
 file. This is a public website. The only secret you need is the API base URL.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://yummy-321287803064.asia-south1.run.app
CORS: The main backend seems to handle CORS directly (our dashboard hits it without a proxy). If you face CORS errors on localhost, try running chrome with disabled web security for testing, or deploy to Vercel/Netlify which usually work better.
4. Tech Stack
Framework: Use simple HTML/JS or Next.js (if you prefer React).
Styling: TailwindCSS (CDN or installed).
Design:
Clean, appetizing, card-based layout.
Mobile-responsive (mostly used on phones).
Sticky header for categories.
4. Implementation Steps for You
Initialize: Set up the project structure.
Fetch: Write a script to hit the backend and log the JSON response to understand the structure (fields like name, price, image_url, category_id).
Render: Build the UI to map this JSON into a beautiful grid.
Refine: Add a "Search" bar to filter items instantly.
5. Sample Fetch Code
const API_URL = 'https://yummy-321287803064.asia-south1.run.app';
const RESTAURANT_ID = 1; // Replace with dynamic ID
async function fetchMenu() {
  try {
    // Try products first
    const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/products?restaurant_id=${RESTAURANT_ID}`);
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log("Menu Data:", data);
    return data;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to load menu", err);
  }
}
Please generate the full code for this site.
